<span class="org-level-1">Teaching Statement</span>

I have been engaged in mathematics pedagogy, formally at the university level
since 2012 and informally via private tutoring since 2007. See my <a href="CV.html">CV</a> for more
detail and my teaching statement for my thoughts on the matter. The bulk of my 
experience teaching college coursework is in the context of calculus, linear algebra, 
and differential equations in the Duke Mathematics Department. The most involved among
this teaching experience was in the context of serving as instructor of record for 
Math 212: Intro to Calculus II in Fall 2015 and as discussion section TA for 
Math 216: Linear Algebra and Differential Equations in both semesters of the 2016-17
academic year. 

Most recently, in Spring 2018, I had the privilege of teaching
Math 490: Introduction to Category Theory and Mathematized Thinking under the aegis
of the Bass Fellowship, Instructor of Record. Category theory is the area of
mathematics in which I specialize, and concerns itself with cataloging and composing
the various conceptual maneuvers encountered across mathematical areas, 
independent of their content. This was one of the very first undergraduate 
category theory courses ever offered in the country. There was hence a need to
produce customized curricular materials. In particular, I wrote from scratch
these <a href ="main.pdf">lecture notes</a> which served as a self-contained
text for the course. In addition, I developed my own problem sets, hyper-linked
below in both .pdf and .tex format, the latter of which I made available 
to the students to faciliate their production of LaTeX formatted solutions.

When I'd begun teaching mathematics, I solely considered the structuring of the
material, while ignoring how it was to be presented to the actual students.
My first teaching experience---giving basement lectures to the top mathematics 
students two years below me at my high school---did not go as planned: despite 
giving a highly original---at least for a high-schooler---presentation of the 
material of AP calculus, I did not end up communicating my understanding to the
students, in large part because I presented to them the finished product of my
years of digesting the material and hadn't at all revealed the thought machinations
that led to my current understanding. As I matured, mathematically but also
emotionally, I learned to articulate my thought process itself. This was not only
more insightful as to helping guide them through their own oddyssey through
the material, but also to dissolve the false authority of my role as a teacher
and the problematic mythology of some kind of intellectual superiority that
it often implies. Rather, such an approach facilitated a sense that mathematics
was an adventure within one's mind that every one who currently understands
it had to go through. This is why, in deviation from much of the published
material on the subject, I focus my lecture notes on the thought process
underlying a concept as opposed to merely presenting its formal packaging.
Several students have reached out to me about how these lecture notes had 
helped them absorb material they had been struggling through.

I believe that the learning experience needs to be exhilerating and welcoming.
I make an effort to create a casual and friendly atmosphere in the classroom,
so that students feel less shy about asking questions, feel less desire for
the clock to run out, and most importantly have their affective barriers to
learning minimized via removing any pressure of appearing a certain way.
One difficulty I have faced in this approach is in its reflection of my 
aversion to being and being seen as an authority figure. Although I surely
enjoy demonstrating my mastery of the subject, I had always shied away from
more administrative control, e.g. in the context of homework assignments.
For instance, I developed a reputation for being extremely lax with late 
submissions. Although I stand by the positive effect of pressure relief for
the more honest students, I now acknowledge that I enabled other students,
who struggle more with motivation, to guiltlessly fall behind in the course,
thus jeopardizing the health of their learning experience. My primary goal
for future development as a teacher is to strike a balance between creating
a friendly, more horizontal, space for learning with providing students with
greater structure in their deliverables so as to better track their progress
through the material.
